## Core Library ##

The system will have a library of methods and constructors that will act as the foundation for the system.  This library will allow developers of study buddies to access code that controls the system to create study buddies. It acts as ActionLister listening to all the events in the system, and determines what to do next.

Includes methods for:
  * GUI control – Window creation, switch and manipulation, such as User selection menu, Buddy selection menu, and Statictis menu, etc..
  * Statistics access/retrieval
  * Media controller – Loading, displaying, playing of images and sounds
  * Directory controller - Creating, deleteing user/buddy directories
