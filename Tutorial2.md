## Introduction ##
By now you know you've created your first account logged on to the program. Now it's time for you to learn how to start up one of the many study buddies our program has to offer.

## Step by Step ##
  1. Log in to the program, as [Tutorial 1](Tutorial1.md) showed you.
  1. The first thing you will see is the screen below. Since we want to start a study buddy, click on the "Study Buddies" button to go to the next screen.

  1. You will notice a list of buddies on the left side of the next screen. One of these buddies is a darker colour than the others. This is because that buddy is selected. The selected buddy is shown in a panel over on the right side of the screen, so you can know more about it.

  1. If you want to go back at any time, all you have to do is hit the "Back" button.  This button works in Buddies too.
