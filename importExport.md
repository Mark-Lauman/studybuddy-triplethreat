## Installer ##
Installing study buddies is a technical task, so we will create an installer to make the process simple.  Users browse to find the .jar file containing the study buddy to add it in the appropriate location and enabled for all students who can use it.

## Exporter ##
If one teacher wants to use another teacher's study buddy, the program allows them to export any study buddy they have so that another teacher can use it.  No data is transferred while exporting, only the buddy itself.
