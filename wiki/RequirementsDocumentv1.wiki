==Introduction==
Our system provides an educational learning tool to students of the sixth and seventh grade. It does so by having a code library that third party “Study Buddies” have access to to create programs. The system also keeps track of individual users and user statistics.  Study buddies can be imported into and exported out of the system to allow sharing of study buddies.  The study buddies are able to display images, play sounds, and take in events from input devices.
This study buddy system is useful for helping students study for a potentially wide variety of subjects on a digital medium.  It is also useful because of its portability and compatibility.  The program will be just a couple of megabytes and all it is needed to run it is computer with Java.
