== Difficulty Gradient ==

Each study buddy will adjust its difficulty as the students progresses through the buddy.
If the student answers two questions incorrectly, then difficulty level will decrease by one. On the other hand, the difficulty level will increase by one if answered correctly. There are three difficulty levels, easy, medium, and hard. Activities will depend on the user's statistics of previous use of the system and adjust the difficulty of the next question.
