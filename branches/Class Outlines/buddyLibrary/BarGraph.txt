BarGraph Synopses

Package: buddyLibrary
Extends: JPanel

Members:
private ArrayList<Float> scores
	The scores that are displayed on the screen
private BufferedImage disp
	The image displayed when paint is called
private float max
	The value of the highest point visible on the graph
private float min
	The value of the lowest point visible on the graph

Methods:
public BarGraph()
	Creates the BarGraph
	Initially, the bar graph has a white background, black foreground and no stored scores


private ArrayList<Float> calculateDisplayData()
	Calculates how the data will be displayed by pixel
private ArrayList<Rectangle> makeBars(ArrayList<Float> data)
	Constructs the bars that will be drawn.  When render ends these bars are deleted
private void render(Graphics g)
	redraws disp so it is up to date
	Text, axis and bars will take on the foreground colour of this panel
	The background will be the background colour
	The y axis label is only drawn if the graph is 95 px + tall
public void resetAll()
	Restore the BarGraph to its initial state, and force disp to redraw
	Does not change the background or foreground colours
public void setScores(float[] values)
	Clears the current scores, and replaces them with values
	Updates min and max
	Forces disp to redraw
	Floats accepted:
		Positive floats will graph as a positive bar graph
		Negative floats are accepted, and will be graphed correctly
		If all the floats in values follow this rule: 1 >= all floats >= 0
			then they will be interpreted as percents and graphed accordingly


public void repaint()
	forces disp to redraw itself
public void paint(Graphics g)
	repaints disp on the screen
	render is called if the size of the panel has changed, one of the functions
		that forces redraw has been called, or there is no disp drawn presently
